        <button>Click Me</button>
        <p>Look, it's a button!</p>
        <p>It surely doesn't <i>do</i> anything</p>
        <p>We haven't learned about JavaScript yet!</p>
        <p>I wonder what it does</p>
        <p>Probably something really fun</p>
        <p>I'm so excited to click the button</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll be the first person ever to press it</p>
